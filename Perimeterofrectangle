# Here is a program to calculate perimeter of rectangke by taking user input.
# l is the length od rectanfle while b is the breadth of rectangle.

# formula of perimeter of rectangle = 2*(l+b)

l=float(input("Enter the length of rectangle:"))
b=float(input("Enter the breadth of rectangle:"))

perimeter = 2*(l+b)

print("Permieter of rectagle from the data given is: ",perimeter)
